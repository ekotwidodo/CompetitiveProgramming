# Competitive Programming Solutions in Java

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems, implemented in Java. The problems are sourced from the [Competitive Programming Training Gate by Ikatan Alumni TOKI](https://tlx.toki.id/).

---

### ðŸ’¡ Project Goal
The main objective of this repository is to document my journey in mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each problem serves as a practical exercise to:
* Enhance my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
* Gain a deeper understanding of algorithm design patterns.
* Improve my implementation skills and code efficiency in Java.

---

### ðŸ’» Structure
The code is organized by problem sets or topics. You will find each solution in its directory, typically named after the problem.

---

### ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run the code, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can compile and run the programs from your terminal:

```bash
# Compile the code
javac Solution.java

# Run the compiled program
java Solution
```

Or because the base of this repository is a Java Project, you can run the solutions for each file, as shown in the image below.
